			<p>Welcome to the jFLAC project! After a lengthy period without development, a new wave of development has begun.
			As part of this, the source code has moved to a Git source repository, 
			<a href="http://jflac.git.sourceforge.net">http://jflac.git.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
			<p>During this phase of development, the information on this website may be slightly out of date.
			This will hopefully be resolved quickly, but in case of any doubt, please contact the developers on the 
			<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jflac/forums">jFLAC forums</a> or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=106536">mailing lists</a>.</p>
			<p>Thanks for your interest in jFLAC!</p>

			<p>This release adds the ability to set listeners to the player application.

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 1.1</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release fixes a bug in the java Sound SPI. This bug caused a problem when
			the jFLAC SPI was used in a player with oother SPIs. It would prevent non-flac
			files from being played if the jFLAC SPI was included in the class path.</p>

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 1.0</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>The most significant change in this release is the inclusion of a Java Sound SPI
               module. To use the Java Sound SPI, simply include the jFLAC jar file in your
               classpath. Other changes include:
			<ul>
   				<li>FlacPacker application. This application packs a number of individual flac files into one flac file.
   				    The separate flac files are indexed with a seek table.</li>
   				<li>SeekTablePlayer application. This application plays a section of a flac file between two seek points.</li>
   				<li>InputBitStream renamed to BitInputStream.</li>
				<li>OutputBitStream renamed to BitOutputStream.</li>
				<li>StreamDecoder renamed to FLACDecoder.</li>
				<li>StreamEncoder renamed to FLACEncoder.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>This release includes bug fixes and some cleanup to the jFLAC library:
			<ul>
   				<li>A fix was made to Player.java to flush all output to the device before closing the line.</li>
   				<li>Modified the Player.java app so that one instance can play back multiple files.</li>
   				<li>Added a decodeStreamInfo and decodeFrame function to StreamDecoder.</li>
				<li>Added a processError to the FrameListener interface.</li>
				<li>Added a Tester sample application that counts and prints out internal FLAC errors.</li>

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 0.4</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release features a new player application that will play a flac file
			using the Java sound API. I've also added new listener interfaces to the library.
			The FrameListener is called after every flac packet is processed. This is now
			used by the Analyser application. The PCMProcessor is called after every frame
			is decoded. This is now used by the Decoder application</p>
